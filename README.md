# ReduxTodoApp
Todo App is made up with Redux library. Basically, redux is state management library. Redux is used mostly for application state management. To summarize it, Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which can't be changed directly. When something changes, a new object is created (using actions and reducers).
